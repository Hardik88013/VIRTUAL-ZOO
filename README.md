question number 90 virtual zoo
in this me and my team had worked on making an html based front page for the site VIRTUAL ZOO
Designed a  HTML page to display holograms of existing and extinct species of flora and fauna to depict complex ecosystems from various parts of the world. The virtual zoo could be displayed in schools, museums, and Ministries without using much physical space. The zoo could also hold educational sessions about the environment within the virtual space using pre-recorded videos of teachers from around the world.
